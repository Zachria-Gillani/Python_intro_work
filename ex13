from sys import argv
#read the WYSS section for how to run This
#from system import argv, wrgv is imported from pythons library when I run this code allowing me to use argv.
#This argv or arguments are new to me as of this chapter and
#you have to use the command line to get the result.  Meaning you need to not just write python ex13.py
#To make the program run, but I also need to list 3 variables (not 4) such as apple, orange and dragonfruit.
script, first, second, third = argv

#Argv is different than input beause user has to input info at the command line whearas in input, its done in python

#The above line of code takes the items to the left of the
# equals sign and allows them to be "unpacked" when argv or argument variables
#keyword is used.

print(">>>> argv=", repr(argv))
#Idk what this is but will be explained later.
print("The script is called:", script)
print("Your first cariable is:", first)
print("Your second variable is:", second)
print("Your third variable is:", third)

dog = input("Do you have a dog?")
cat = input("I hope you have no cats")

print(f"Well {dog} and {cat} is that right")



#The code above this is a series of print lines.  Print is great for debuggin!!
#Also this allows the argv to be stated which herw if I key into the command line, apple orange dragonfruit after python ex13.py will be exaclty that.
