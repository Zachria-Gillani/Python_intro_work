#What I did above was to take a variable list name such as fruits and then with the
#brackets I am making a list.  Lists can have integers or strings but have to be in the above formet and seperated by commas and for strings,
#strings must be set off with ''

#this first kind of for-loop goes through a list
#This below for is used like def is, the next word "number" could be anything
#It could be "abstract" O would just have to call "abstract in the function of the print line
#When it says "in" it allows whatever im using for to describe to use said list
#so the word that i use does not matter there its a random for loop variable not function but for loop

for number in the_count:
    print(f"This is count {number}")

#same as Above
for fruits in fruits:
    print(f"A fruit of type: {fruits}")

    #also we can go through mixed lists too
    #notice we have to use {} since we don't know what's in it
for i in change:
    print(f"I got {i}")
#Here all I am doing is making another loop but with a random variable name or for loop names
#which is "I" since we dunno what we are going to use in this mixed lists

#We can also build lists, first start with an empty one
elements = []
#I am making an open list here with name elements.  Just another way to make a list

#then use the range function to fo 0 to 5 counts
for i in range(0,6):
    print(f"Adding {i} to the list.")
    #append is a function that lists understand
    elements.append(i)
#Above I am using the range function which allows my i variable to have something use as an increasing metric.
#Then I am using a function/loop to use a predef function on list elements
#which allows me to add on i which is an increasing variable 0-6 to the printed sort_words

#Without the code block of 32-39 we wouldnt be able to
#utilize the code below
#now we can print them out too
for i in elements:
    print(f"Element was:{i}")
