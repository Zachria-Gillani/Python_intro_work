#A function is defined as a block of organized, reusable code used to
# perform a single, related action. Python has many built-in functions; you can also create your own. Python has an input function
#which lets you ask a user for some text input. You call this function to tell the program to stop and wait for the user to key
#in the data. In Python 2, you have a built-in function raw_input(), whereas in Python 3, you have input(). The program will resume once
#the user presses the ENTER or RETURN key. Look at this example to get input from the keyboard using Python 2 in the interactive mode. Your
#output is displayed in quotes once you hit the ENTER key.

#here I am printing a statement and end= ' ' allows for the variable weight= x the x will go there or whatever your weight is

#I cannot put a variable in the input() section or else the user wont be able to put in their answer and the code will read an error binary

#This is used to calculate things like BMI cause you can enter lots of different
#data into the thing and it can do things like calculations or respond in a certain manner
#like i could make it say answer + answer1 and have a new thing in the pprinted message


print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")
#if i put nothing into the brackets {age} and so on, then nothing will appear

print("How will he make it?")
print("He works so hard", end = ' ')
answer = input()
print("Do you like the muffin man?", end = ' ')
answer2 = input()
print(f"So you are {answer} going to say {answer2} to pasta?" f"you are going to be {answer} + {answer2}.")
