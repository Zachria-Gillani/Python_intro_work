#Below i am writing if and then a boolean logic statement.  If it is true, then the first line
#of code that says print will print when ran.  However, if the first if statement if not True
#Then it foes down to elif, which has it's own boolean logic statement.
#If that boolean is true, then it will print.
#However, if "if" and "elif" are false than the else statement will print
