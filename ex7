#watch that comma at the end.  try removing it to see what happens
print(end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, end='')
#Without the "," at the end of end6...the whole code messes up. Also, the end='', allows for a space to be made.
print(end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12)
#this is the end of the code.  the plus sign allows for the variabels to be placed side by side with no space. '' allows for spaces tho.
